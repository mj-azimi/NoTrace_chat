        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            At NoTrace_chat, we value and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our secure chat tool. By using NoTrace_chat, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            NoTrace_chat does not collect any personal information from its users. All communications within the tool are encrypted and stored locally on the user’s device. No server-side storage or tracking is involved, ensuring that your conversations remain private and secure.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
            Since NoTrace_chat does not collect any personal data or store any messages on servers, there is no use of your information beyond the scope of the chat itself. The tool’s purpose is to provide secure and anonymous communication between users without compromising your privacy.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We take the security of your data seriously. Since NoTrace_chat operates with end-to-end encryption, all communications between users are secured and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the intended recipients.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
            NoTrace_chat does not rely on third-party services that would require you to share personal information. Our tool operates independently to ensure complete user privacy.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            NoTrace_chat reserves the right to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and you are encouraged to review the policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
